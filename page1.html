           Project is to maintain existing Fig tress and search for Grapes tress that can be grow 
           in the garden.
          
           How to Plant a Fig Tree:
          
          First step is to prepare the site by digging a hole twice as wide and twice as deep as 
          the treeâ€™s root ball. Add compost or manure to enrich the soil and help retain moisture. 
          Place the root ball in the center of the hole and spread out its roots around it before 
          filling it with soil. Firmly tamping down on the soil will help ensure there are no air pockets.
          

          How to Harvest & prune:
          

         Once Figs are soft and fragrant they are ready to be harvest in late summer. 
         Once they are ready twist the fruit off gently in order to avoid damage the branches.
          It is also important to prune your fig trees regularly in order to keep them healthy and produce more fruit. 
          Pruning helps maintain a desirable shape while encouraging strong growth and larger yields. During winter, prune any dead or damaged branches and thin out crowded tree areas for better air circulation. 
          In late spring, cut back any limbs competing with each other for light or space.
