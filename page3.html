    Figs are the fruit of a tree in the Ficus genus, native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe. 
    These trees grow best in warm climates and can reach heights of up to 30 feet when mature. 
    A single fig tree can produce up to 500 fruits each season. 
    The fruits have a unique shape, with thin, leathery skin and soft, sweet pulp. 
    The seeds are small and crunchy, adding texture to dishes.
    
    Types of Figs: 
    Although there are about 750 different types of Figs but only few are cultivated widely such as 
    <p class="font-bold"> Calimyrna, Mission, and Kadota </p>

    "Calimyrna figs have light green skin with golden flesh and a sweet flavor. 
    They are commonly found dried or preserved and often used in baking.
    Mission figs have a purplish-brown skin and a sweet, jammy flavor. 
    They are most commonly eaten fresh but can also be found dried or canned.
    Kadota figs have pale yellow skin with golden flesh and an intense sweetness. 
    These figs are often used in jams, jellies, pastries, and desserts".
